Python_cleaned is the reporitory containing all data and code for my master thesis research. 

This repository contains 2 folders: data and scripts. 
- The data folder contains all data of 2 test dates:
    - 02/13: when 8 non WC users were measured during 8 functional wheelchair tests, using an IMU and 3D MOCAP system
    - 03/21: when 8 elite wheelchair basketball athletes were measured during 8 functional wheelchair tests, using an IMU and 3D MOCAP system
- The scripts folder contains 3 files: functions.py, TrunkMotionValidation.ipynb, TrunkPerformanceClass_Analysis.ipynb
    - functions.py: contains all functions that are used in the other Jupyter notebooks
    - TrunkMotionValidation.ipynb: contains all code to perform the validation of 3 IMUs placed on the back, lower back and wheelchair when compared to a 3D motion capture system
    - TrunkPerformanceClass_Analysis.ipynb: contains all code to perform a correlation analysis into the trunk motion, wheelchair performance and classification of elite wheelchair basketball athletes
